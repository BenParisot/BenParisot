# :wave: Howdy! I'm Ben Parisot. 

I'm an experienced FE/FS developer and engineering manager. I work primarily in JavaScript, React, Node, and TypeScript. I currently manage the engineering team at Planet Argon, a Ruby-on-Rails development agency. [Go check out our work here!](https://www.planetargon.com/work)

Some of my most used and most valuable skill sets include:
- :technologist: Full-stack development (JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, GraphQL, MongoDB, )
- :test_tube: TDD and code coverage advocacy (Jest, Cypress, CodeCov, CodeClimate)
- :eyes: Site performance monitoring and optimization (Pingdom, New Relic, bottleneck resolution, WCAG compliance, on-page search optimization)
- :art: UI design implementation (Material-UI, Bootstrap, CSS/SCSS, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, InVision, Figma, Sketch)
- :bar_chart: Data-driven search and social marketing (A/B testing, Google Ads, Semrush, Moz, Power BI)
- :busts_in_silhouette: Stakeholder management (request prioritization, ticket estimation, sprint report generation, product and design team communication )

In my spare time I enjoy cooking dinner with my husband and friends, creating reactive particle systems in TouchDesigner, hiking with my dogs, and reading comics. I'm currently learning to play the piano and hope to one day write a novel. :two_men_holding_hands: :dog2: :musical_keyboard: :writing_hand:
