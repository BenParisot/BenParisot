ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Ben Parisot. I'm an experienced full-stack developer and engineering manager. I work primarily in JavaScript, React, and Node, though I've messed around plenty in Rails and Python. 
Some of my most used and most valuable skill sets include:
- :technologist: Full-stack development (JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, Redux, GraphQL, MongoDB, )
- :test_tube: TDD and code coverage advocacy (Jest, Cypress, CodeCov, CodeClimate)
- :eyes: Site performance monitoring and optimization (Pingdom, New Relic, bottleneck resolution, WCAG compliance, on-page search optimization)
- :art: UI design implementation (Material-UI, Bootstrap, CSS/SCSS, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, InVision, Figma, Sketch)
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data-driven search and social marketing (A/B testing, Google Ads, Semrush, Moz, Power BI)
- :busts_in_silhouette: Stakeholder management (request prioritization, ticket estimation, sprint report generation, product and design team communication )

In my spare time I enjoy cooking dinner with my husband and some friends, hiking with our dogs, and reading comics. I'm currently learning to play the piano and hope to one day write a novel. :two_men_holding_hands: :dog2: :musical_keyboard: :writing_hand:
